Loan Approval Estimator:
The aim of this project is to estimate if a person will get loan from a bank or not. The software will create a model that will decide the probability of a person to repay the loan on time. The model will work on different factors such as user's gender, marital status, income, education etc. 
We will take these values as input and compare with the model that is formed from a previous dataset. Thus we will predict if the loan will be approved or not.
